### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack software developer. My passion is learning and contributing to development community. I am currently going through CS50, TheOdinProject, and freecodecamp coursework to expand my knowledge in the field. I am looking to collaborate on any java, website, or python projects.
